Hey dear Imedia24 GmbH Recruiter ðŸ‘‹,


### My PokeDex ðŸŒ±

In order to write the frontend in a way that would showcase my skills when it comes to React, I chose to not abstract most of the logic through the use of a framework but rather couple multiple libraries to achieve the desired goal. Axios for data fetching needs, tailwind css and styled-components for styling the UI, and the full use of TypeScript throughout the app as it is fully responsive. Enjoy the music and the PokeDex with multiple generations of Pokemons from the first seasons to the latest ones.

Made with Love and **Javascript** using **React** and **TypeScript**.
